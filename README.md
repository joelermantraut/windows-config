# windows-config
A guide to config Windows system like I use it.

Steps
1. Install [Tabby Terminal](https://tabby.sh/).
2. Open Tabby. Go to last option (Config File). Select "Show Config File". 
3. Copy - paste config.yaml file in Tabby directory.
4. Install (Git)[https://gitforwindows.org/].
5. Install (PowerToys)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/]. It is a set of tools provided by Windows, with great integration with system. Not forget to review its configuration to select useful tools for you.
6. You can install any password manager. I prefer to use the simpler one, I use (pass-winmenu)[https://github.com/geluk/pass-winmenu].
7. You can install (GPG)[https://www.phildev.net/pgp/gpginstall#windows], or in my case, use the included in pass-winmenu downloaded directory.
